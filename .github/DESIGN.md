## Theme

``Bounce``

<br>

## Concept

You're a miner who goes down levels of a mine.<br>
As you make your way through these levels you try to collect as much ore as you can.<br>
However staying on one level for too long can be dangerous due to the monsters that accumulate overtime.<br>
It's all about balancing risk vs reward to get the most out of your descent.

Each level is randomly generated with an entrance, exit, ores, and monsters.<br>
The longer you stay in a level the more monsters will spawn.<br>
Encouraging you to move quickly and choose your moves carefully.

The game is turn-based meaning that every entity moves or attacks at the same time.<br>
A turn only happens if the player moves, or performs an action. (like attacking)

Attacking an enemy causes them to bounce back, messing with the order which causes you to get hit if you move towards the enemy again.<br>
And you cannot just wait for the enemy to move towards you, so now you are motivated to perform an action to avoid being attacked.
